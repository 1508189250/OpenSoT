OpenSoT
=========

An Open Source Task Solving library with Constraints

Introduction
------------
OpenSoT is a library dedicated to control robots under constraints such as joint limits, joint velocities and so on. The main idea under OpenSoT is to decouple Task and Constraints description with Solver and Type of Control.

OpenSoT is developed under the European Project WALK-MAN: http://www.walk-man.eu/.

Its homepage resides in http://github.com/robotology-playground/OpenSoT
You can also find a wiki there.
